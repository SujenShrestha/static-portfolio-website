								<ol type="1">
								<li>Transportation: </li>
									<p>The technology has improved the transportation significantly over the years. Before we would be limited to travel only within nearby areas as there was no means to travel very far. Nowadays, we have access various transportation mediums for land, water and air transportation like cars, buses, trains, ships, airplanes, etc. The transportation technology has enabled massive number of people to travel between places simultaneously. With the enhancement of travel many other activities gets enhanced as well. Therefore, technology has created significant contribution for efficiency in transportation. </p>

Because of this, we don’t have to wait for the mail to be delivered physically from one part of the world to another or go to someone’s house to just deliver a message and so on. Therefore, technology has significantly reduced the time and effort required for communication process.</p>
								<li>Education: </li>

						<h2 id="Negative">Negative Impacts of Technology</h2>
							<br>
							<img src="../images/Tech Negative.jpg" class="center"><br>
								<p>The technology has been created for making our life easier and better and it also does in so many different ways. However, there are also a number of aspects where the technology has a negative impact. Some of which are elaborated below:</p>
						<ol type="1">
							<li>Health:</li>
								<p>There is no doubt that the technology has made our life easier and convenient. However, these conveniences have made a lot of people lazy. Compared to previous generations, we don’t need to do perform much physical activities as the technologies have made transporting accessories much easier. We can do most of our daily activities and work from within our homes. Also, we can entertain ourselves with various content and get food and other accessories delivered to our homes. Because of all these facilities, people just sit in the same place playing games, watching movies, etc. This makes people lazy, inactive and addicted to mobile and computers. Such practice can cause severe physical as well as psychological health problems over a period of time. Therefore, overuse of technology without physical activity can cause major health issues.</p>
							<li>Environment:</li>
								<p>In order to mass produce technological devices, various industries need to extract the resources from the planet and the process of manufacturing them generally dissipates a lot of unwanted chemicals and gases. These chemicals get mixed in the river and gases in the air. Such pollutants affect adversely on the health and well-being of the people as well as the environment. The raw materials used for manufacturing the technical equipments are extracted from the earth through various mining processes and after they become unusable, damaged or obsolete. They get discarded as waste. Moreover, the machines and devices produce a lot of unwanted sound while operating which creates disturbance for the nearby people. Therefore, the technology manufacturing process causes various types of land, water, air and noise pollution.</p>
							<li>Security:</li>
								<p>Most people nowadays have access to internet and actively use it on a daily basis. Various social media applications, online banking applications, computers connected to a network, etc. contain various information, some of which may be personal and contain sensitive information such as personal details, bank account details, company product details, etc. Since these information are stored online, the information can be hacked by cyber criminals, who may destroy or sell the sensitive company information, steal money or cause harm to individuals as well as companies. Most people who are not tech savvy and companies that have not taken measures to secure their information, can fall victim to such attacks and various scams. Therefore, the technology has various vulnerabilities and flaws which may compromise the security of valuable information.</p>
							</ol>
							<br>
						<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
							<br>
							<p>In short, we can say that technology surely has made our lives better by reducing the time and effort we need to put to complete certain activities. The technology has made transportation, communication, education, business and many other areas significantly convenient. But along with all the benefits there are also various disadvantages that the technology brings like affecting the health and wellbeing of all the plants, animals and the environment as well as creating various security risks which may cause huge loss for individuals and companies. So, to minimize these effects we must reuse, reduce and recycle the technologies as much as possible to minimize the resource exhaustion. Also, we must learn and apply the measures to secure our online presence as well as involve ourselves in physical activities so we can stay healthy and fit. Thus, the technology can become very useful instruments if used properly but it can also cause severe loss if we do not pay proper attention to its negative aspects.</p>
